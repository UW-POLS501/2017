# Draft Proposal

In one to two paragraphs propose a research project for this course.
State your research question. 
Describe what data you will be using to address that question.
If you were in POLS 500, will this be a continuation of your POLS 500 final project.

The primary purpose of this proposal is to get you thinking about your question immediately and put an idea on paper.
We will be able to give feedback, and you can adjust your proposal in the next draft.

Turn in as a `.docx`, `.odf`, or `.pdf` file via [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1098109/assignments/3566710).
