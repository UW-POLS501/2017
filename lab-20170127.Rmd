# Function Challenge

## Create a new function, called my_function
# Your function will take two numeric arguments
# Name the first argument "a" and the second argument "b"
# Your function should take the square root of a, then
# multiply it by b to the 5th power.
# Then have your function print out the following message:
# "The solution is" followed by the calculated quantity.




# Run your function for the following pair of values for a and b: 
# 10, .5 (save the solution as result1)
# 2.2, 1.1 (save the solution as result2)



# Modify your function so it only prints two decimal places
# Name your new function my_function2



# Check that it worked with the same two test sets for a and b:


####################################
# Iteration challenge, with vectors

# Create a vector, called values1, which contains the following numbers: 3, 7, 9, 4, 5, 1, 6
# Create another vector, called values2, which contains the following numbers: 
# 0.6, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.8, 1.4, 0.2



## Run my_function2 using the two new vectors for a (values1) and b (values2).
## Use a loop!


# Try it again, this time after you remove the last number in values2. What happens?


## Why is your last value what you might not expect?


##############################################################
## Extra challenge: revert back to your old values2. 
## Instead of printing out the function's solution, save the numeric solution in
## a new vector called "results", then print out the results vector.
## Hint -- you may want to adjust the function and/or the loop!
