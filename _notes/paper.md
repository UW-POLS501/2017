James Long's rules for an article introduction


1. Start with a puzzle. (theoretical, methodological, empirical) Why should
    the reader care? And state your research question.
2. "Prior approaches to the study of ..." Discuss how this research question
    relates to existing research.
3. State your approach and your hypotheses for answering the question.
4. Discuss the methods and data you will use to test the hypotheses
5. Preview the results
6. Discuss the contributions of these results to the literature (try for 3 contributions).
    This is where you state who "should care" about your research.
