# Learning Objectives



## POLS 501

- Load tabular data from commonly encountered (structured) data sources
- Clean and transform data to a form appropriate to conduct statistical analysis
- Visualize data and statistical models in order to meaningfully convey results,
- Communicate research results in a paper
- Estimate a Linear regression model
- Interpret linear regression coefficients and statistical significance

Topics

- Programming in R
- R for data cleaning and visualization
- Probability distributions
- Sampling distributions
- Hypothesis Testing: significance tests and p-values
- linear regression (but how far to go?)

## POLS 503

- Linear regression in matrix form
- Assumptions of OLS. Identification and solutions.
- Identify threats to causal inference and the assumptions required to interpret
   statistical results causally
- Identify the different objectives of statistical research: exploration, prediction, and causal inference
- Identify the difference between "model based" and "design based" approaches
- Visualization ...
- Communication ...

Topics

- Hypothesis testing
- Linear regression
- Bootstrapping
- Cross Validation
- Potential Outcomes Framework
- Panel Data (Fixed effects, random effects)
- Difference in Difference
- Regularized Regression

# Prerequisites

- For 501: Basic calculus? Need to know what a derivative is.
- For 503: Matrix algebra basics. Need a project to work on.

# Text books

## 501

- Bailey "Real Stats"
- OpenIntro (Optional)
- Monihan
- JHU Linear Regression book ?
- Freedman, Purves, Pisani (Stats) ?
- A Mathematics Course for Political & Social Scientists (optional)
- Data Camp (optional)
- R books (optional)

Not used:

- Gailmard: the big-picture chapters are useful; otherwise the math is heavier than needed.

## 503

- Bailey "Real Stats"
- Monihan
- Mastering Metrics or Mostly Harmless Econometrics
- Kennedy Guide to Econometrics (optional)
- Intro to Statistical Learning in R (free online): for bootstrapping, CV, regularized regression.

Not used:

- Fox: students don't like
- Wooldridge: I don't know if anyone read it. Expensive.
