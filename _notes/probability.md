# Chapter 6: Probability

## Probability

### Frequentist v. Bayesian


- Frequentist:  limit of the relative frequency with which an event of interest occurs when the number of experiments repeatedly conducted under the same conditions approaches to infinity
- Bayesian: interprets probability as oneâ€™s subjective belief about the likelihood of event occurrence.


### Probability Axioms

1. The probability of any event A is non-negative.
2. Probability that one of the outcomes in the sample space occurs is 1
3. If events A and B are mutually exclusive then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)


The addition rule
$$
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
$$

Law of total probability
$$
P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and B^C)
$$

### Permutations

Number of permutations when arranging $k$ objects out of $n$ unique objects is
$$
n P_k  = n x (n - 1) \times \cdots \times (n - k + 2) \times (n - k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}
$$

Birthday question. Probability that two people have the same birthday.

### Combinations

Number of combinations choosing $k$ distinct elements from $n$ elements is
$$
n C k = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n Pk }{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
$$

## Conditional Probability

### Conditional Marginal, and Joint Probabilities

Conditional probability of an event
$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}
$$
Joint probability
$$
P(A and B) = P(A | B)  P(B) = P(B | A) P(A)
$$
Marginal Probability
$$
P(A) = P(A | B) P(B) + P(A | B^3) P(B^C)
$$

Example: Florida voters: race, gender, age.

4 x 4.

### Independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are independent
$$
P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)
$$

### Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule
$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B | A)}
$$
