Submit two files: (1) your R script, and (2) a concise write-up where you report your results. The write-up should be submitted as a PDF file. You may use any program you wish (Word, LaTeX, etc.) to create the write-up, but only submit a PDF.


# Bias in Self-Reported Turnout

*QSS* Ex. 1.5.1

# Understanding Population Dynamics

*QSS* Ex. 1.5.2

- part 1 suggests that you use the `$` operator. You can ignore this and feel free to use an alternative means (e.g., commands from the **tidyverse** [**dplyr**]) instead.

- It occasionally asks you to report results as a "vector of length two." You can instead report your results in a data frame (or a `tibble`), if that makes more sense to you.
