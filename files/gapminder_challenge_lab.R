#### Lab challenge: Plots with ggplot and gapmider data

#### Preliminaries
### Load libraries and install new packages


### Load the data


### What's in the gapminder dataframe?

### Challenge 1: Create a histogram of life expectancy using the gapminder data


### Challenge 2a: Create a scatterplot with the gapminder data with life expectancy on the y axis and 
### GDP per capita on the x axis


### Challenge 2b: Make the same scatterplot as 2a, but now color the points based on the continent

### Challenge 2c: Make the same scatterplot as 2b, but make the size of the points proportional to population


### Super challenge: Try to recreate the plot in the emailed pdf called "gapminder_super_challenge.pdf"
